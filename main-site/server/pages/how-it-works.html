        <p>
          Once the caller completes a simple registration process on the phone, he has successfully booked himself to use the service at the designated time. The booking system then sends him an email and SMS confirming the request, and will also send a message to remind him the day before the appointment.

      <h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
      <h2>Why weâ€™re betting on the web</h2>
      <p>
        The web has served developers well for the last twenty years, and we
        think that makes it a pretty great bet for the next twenty. It
        represents the most stable and time-tested universal runtime in the
        world. And today, the web is the best and only way to deliver the
        seamless experience that users have come to expect as they interact with
        apps across platforms and devices, between desktop and mobile.
